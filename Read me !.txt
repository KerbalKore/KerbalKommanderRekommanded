Here is some useful information:

What is kerbal kommander?

It's a new way to play KSP, you play as a ship pilot who want to create his own space company. You have many ways to earn money: mining, trading, selling scientific research, grabbing asteroids, or even slave/weapon trafficing. This money can be used to buy better ships or hire crew.

- Click on the app button at the bottom left hand corner
- Click on "Create a new Kerbal Kommander Game"
- Choose the characteristics of your kerbal
- Now you're ready!
- First, you need a ship click on a screen and select "Ship shop", a window will appear, now you can buy a ship or create a new one by clicking on "Buy a ship" or "design a new ship" if you haven't already created a ship.
- Then you are ready to earn money by doing trading, mining, selling asteroides, traffic slaves. With this money, you can upgrade your ship, buy more ships, hire crew and become the richest company of the Kerbol system!
